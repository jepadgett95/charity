          Thousands of children per year living in the United States Mid-west
          suffer from a sever lack of flavor in their daily diet. Children whose
          parents say things like "Salt and pepper is all you need" or
          "Mayonaise is spicy" or "What is cumin?" It's a pure tragedy. We here
          at Spice is Nice tm aim to help educate and supply Mid-west families
          with spices and flavors to their everyday bland diets. For just 10
          cents per month or more, you could pull an innocent child from the
          depths of a flavorless hell by contributing to a payload of spices,
          delivered directly to families in need. Please find it in your heart
          to have mercy on these poor children.
